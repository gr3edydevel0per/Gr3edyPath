# Defensive Security

Main tasks in ds : 
1. Preventing intrusion from occurring 
2. Detecting intrusion when they occur and responding properly

## Area of defensive security

SOC :: Security Operation Centre - team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its system  to detect malicious cyber security events 
Areas of interest :
- Vulnerabilities
- Policy Violation
- Un-authorized activities 
- Network Intrusions


#### Threat Intelligence 
in our context intelligence refers to the information you gather and potential enemies . A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system . TI aims to gather information to help company to prepare against potential adversaries 

Intelligence needs data. Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data collection is done from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums. Processing of data aims to arrange them into a format suitable for analysis. The analysis phase seeks to find more information about the attackers and their motives; moreover, it aims to create a list of recommendations and actionable steps.

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response 
- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Malware Analysis
Forensics is the science to investigate crime and establish facts

In defensive sec the focus of digital forensics is shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack 

### Incident Response 

Four major phases of incident response 
1. Preparation
2. Detection and Analysis 
3. Containment , Eradication and Recovery
4. Post Incident Activity

### Malware Analysis 
- static analysis - without running it 
- dynamic analysis - running malware in an sandbox environemtn and monitoring its activities

### SubDomain Enumeration
### Authententication Bypass 
	:: Logic Flaws :: Scenario :: Reset Password
	:: Asked email -> then username
	:: Performed ::
	 `$_REQUEST` variable   stores the post data and data from query string 
	
	 application logic for this variable favours POST data fields rather than the query string, so if we add another parameter to the POST form, we can control where the password reset email gets delivered.
	when then reset sent was request we added our own email address and we received the reset mail of other user
	]
### IDOR :: Insecure direct object reference 
	to check idors create two accounts and compare the information 
### File inclusion
	- Local File Inclusion
	- Remote File inclusion 

 -> file_get_contents causes path traversal vulnerabilities  
##### Remidiation 
 1. Keep system and services, including web application frameworks, updated with the latest version.  
    
2. Turn off PHP errors to avoid leaking the path of the application and other potentially revealing information.
3. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a good option to help mitigate web application attacks.
4. Disable some PHP features that cause file inclusion vulnerabilities if your web app doesn't need them, such as allow_url_fopen on and allow_url_include.  
    
5. Carefully analyze the web application and allow only protocols and PHP wrappers that are in need.
6. Never trust user input, and make sure to implement proper input validation against file inclusion.  
    
7. Implement whitelisting for file names and locations as well as blacklisting.
